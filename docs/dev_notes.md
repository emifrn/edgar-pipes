# Edgar project development notes

These are my personal notes to keep track of progress with the Edgar project. I
share these notes with my loyal assistant Claude who helps me turn these ideas
in working code. The project is becoming complex, and I realize now that I need
to make notes of the architecture ideas as they are implemented. This document
describe concepts and considerations related to specific topics as they occur while developing the project. They do not provide an overview and cohesive picture of the project, but rather a list of important ideas behind it.
